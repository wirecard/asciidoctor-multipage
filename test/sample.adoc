This sample document attempts to showcase the features of the
MultipageHtml5Converter extension.
The output can be generated from the current directory with `asciidoctor
-r ../asciidoctor-multipage.rb -b multipage_html5 sample.adoc`.

These three paragraphs are in the "preamble" area (the first has the `lead`
attribute). This content belongs to the root-level node and is written to the
main output file (`sample.html`, by default).

[[root-inline,root inline anchor]]This paragraph has a titled inline anchor
with id `\[[root-inline]]`. It is linked from <<xrefs2>>.

[[tree]]
== Tree Nodes

The MultipageHtml5Converter splits the document into node types during
processing, based on the value of the `multipage-level` attribute. If a node's
level is equal to the `multipage-level` value specified for it or the nearest
ancestor node, then the node is generated as a leaf node. In this context,
"node" refers to an Asciidoctor Document or Section.

For this document, the following node types are determined. A file is written
for each root, branch, and leaf node. Each content node is included in its
parent (leaf) node file.

**<<sample>>** – `multipage-level=0`, source document root → root node

* <<about-sample>> – level-0 part → leaf node
.. <<tree>> – level-1 chapter → content node
.. <<output>> – level-1 chapter → content node
* <<custom-level>> – `multipage-level=1`, level-0 part → branch node
.. <<custom-chapter-1>> – level-1 chapter → leaf node
... <<xrefs1>> – level-2 section → content node
.. <<custom-chapter-2>> – level-1 chapter → leaf node
... <<xrefs2>> – level-2 section → content node

[[output]]
== Output Files

The MultipageHtml5Converter creates the following five output files from this
`sample.adoc` document.

**<<sample>>** – root node with id/title `\[[sample]]` (from the file name) →
the main output file (<<sample,sample.html>> by default)

* <<about-sample>> – leaf node with id `\[[about-sample]]` →
  <<about-sample,about-sample.html>>
.. <<tree>> – content node → included in parent node
.. <<output>> – content node → included in parent node
* <<custom-level>> – branch node with id `\[[custom-level]]` →
  <<custom-level,custom-level.html>>
.. <<custom-chapter-1>> – leaf node with id `\[[custom-chapter-1]]` →
   <<custom-chapter-1,custom-chapter-1.html>>
... <<xrefs1>> – content node → included in parent node
.. <<custom-chapter-2>> – leaf node with id `\[[custom-chapter-2]]` →
   <<custom-chapter-2,custom-chapter-2.html>>
... <<xrefs2>> – content node → included in parent node

[[custom-level]]
[desc="Shows a custom multipage-level value and additional features"]
= Custom Level Part

This second part has `multipage-level=1` set, which causes level-1 nodes to be
leaf nodes (split into chapters). Nodes above that level are branch (or root)
nodes, while nodes below that level are content nodes.

The first part, <<about-sample>>, has no `multipage-level` attribute set, so
it uses the document-level attribute, which is `multipage-level=0` (split into
parts).

[[custom-chapter-1]]
== One Chapter

This is a level-1 chapter, and attribute value `multipage-level=1` is set at
parent node "<<custom-level>>", so this is generated as a leaf node. All
descendant nodes are generated as content nodes.

[[xrefs1]]
=== Cross-References

This section is a level-2 node and attribute value `multipage-level=1` is set
at ancestor node "<<custom-level>>". Therefore, this section is generated as a
content node (and is included in its parent node).

* See <<xrefs2>> (on another page).
* See the <<xrefs2-inline>> on another page.
* See <<sample>> (the document id/title and root node).

[[custom-chapter-2]]
== Another Chapter

This chapter is a leaf node and contains one section.

[[xrefs2]]
=== More Cross-References

This section is a level-2 node, and is generated as a content node.

* See <<xrefs1>> (on another page).
* [[xrefs2-inline,xrefs2 inline anchor]]This list item has a titled inline
  anchor with id `\[[xrefs2-inline]]`, and is linked from <<xrefs1>>.
* See the <<root-inline>> on the root page.
